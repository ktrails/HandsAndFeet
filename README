HandsAndFeet is evolving; started out as a simple app to add users, require
authentication, and do some cute tricks I've seen in the railscasts from 
ryan bates, such as sortable columns (ascending/descending), pagination of 
results, search, and now specifying which views require an authenticated user
and which ones do not using a before_filter in the main app controller.

Plans are to add blog with comments/comment editing, then a needs/wants 
database for our homeless population. I've been using a Mantis database for
that, but it has a fair amount of cruft associated with S/W problem reports.
I've been working with CAP and have been eyeing Farrel Lifson's RCAP project:

but I don't know that I want to fool with full-blown CAP messages for this...

This is pretty much newbie-see-newbie-do code, learning as I go...
